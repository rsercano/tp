## 🧭 Trip-Planner Relevance

- **Strong** in itinerary aggregation + real-time alerts — ideal for frequent travellers/business trips.  
- **Weakness** for deep “trip discovery” or local experiences compared to full lifestyle/travel guide apps.  
- **Differentiator:** Auto-import booking emails + rich Pro alert/navigation features.  
- **Consideration for Turkey / local markets:** Ensure language/support availability if targeting TR region.
